              <strong>Study Buddy KKW</strong> is a central educational hub created specifically for engineering students at the <strong>K. K. Wagh Institute of Engineering Education & Research (KKWIEER)</strong>, Nashik.

              This project was born out of a simple problem: students wasting valuable time searching across WhatsApp chats, scattered Google Drive directories, and outdated portals for notes and past papers. Study Buddy solves this by organizing all essential materials—PPTs, handwritten notes, syllabus details, and question banks—in a mobile-friendly, single-click interface.
